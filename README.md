# Cub3D

A simple raycaster engine I wrote for the Cub3D project in the 42 programme.
It is based on the great tutorial by [Lode](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)

### Features:

- generation of map based on config file
- 2D surface
- floor/ceiling textures
- sprite textures
- wall and sprite collision
- screenshot to a BMP file
